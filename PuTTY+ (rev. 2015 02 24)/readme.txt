rev 150302

==========
==To do:==
==========
* Cleanup folder
* Button - if 0, then 1, etc. if 09, then 10, etc (gross)
* Button - if sm, then med, etc
* GUI overhaul
* Read / call
* Hide PuTTY (maybe not possible)

===========
=Important=
===========
1. Versions of PuTTY+ after 150302 need to be placed in a folder named
"PuTTY+" as such that the .ahk file itself exists as follows:

"C:\Users\aechoi\Desktop\PuTTY+\PuTTY+ (rev. 3 Feb 2015)\putty+.ahk"

".ahk" is simply a filetype; your system may not be configured to show it.
Do not change the name to include ".ahk".

2. PuTTY+ relies on AutoHotkey to run. Download the most current version from
http://www.autohotkey.com/.
